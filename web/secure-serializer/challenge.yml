flags:

hints:
  - "`strip_pickle` function is not relevant to the solution"
  - "You need to manipulate the length of the initial payload so that the padded string fits well as a serialized object (minimum number of null bytes), and at the same time the last block containing the bit length should fit perfectly as pickle deserialization instructions. Time to read about the pickle specification !"
