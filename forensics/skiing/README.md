## Description

Our Club's designer -Bob- was acting weird past days.. Our HR team finds out that he was 'somehow' hiding some secrets in our Github repository!
but they cannot find anything! just some Logos and a page cover, after i called Bob to meet him asap he said:" hey Boss, i'm so sorry.. it is snowing outside!
So i'm going For Skiing, i can't miss this chance! the most important thing in skiing is you have to be having fun. If youâ€™re having fun, then everything else will come easy to you. **_Call ended_**"  
  
 > ouff... i can't wait.. so i want you to catch him! i'm wondering how a designer could hide a secret!.
